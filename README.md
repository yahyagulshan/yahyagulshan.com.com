# [YahyaGulshanWeb](https://yahyagulshan.com/)
A static website built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the theme [LoveIt](https://hugoloveit.com). This website is hosted in an AWS S3 bucket and continuous deployment is provided by GitHub Actions. I have configured the domain name [yahyagulshan.com](https://yahyagulshan.com/) to point to an AWS CloudFront distribution which deploys the contents of the S3 bucket to edge locations all over the world.
